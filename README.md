# A simple project

A project to learn some C++ and physics simulation.

# Todo
- [X] Arbitrary objects in scene;
- [X] Refactor code (Draw function, physics function, State struct);
- [X] Color In Circle;
- [X] Random Circle Generator;
- [X] Colision between objects;
- [ ] Inclined plane ();
- [ ] Fix colision between objects (they get stuck to each other)
- [X] fix time slowing down when computer is slow.
- [X] fix energy loss/gain on boundry colision
- [ ] fix energy loss/gain in general
- [ ] make position/velocity unit be meters and meters/second
- [ ] make reference start from bottom
